today I looked at what I have been doing so far and I decided to start from scratch again and do each step myself.

I thought about how I noticed that many DS jobs ask for cloud and big data tech and I don't have any knowledge or experience of these so I wanna implement it into the project.

so I put together a project plan of some sort, looked at what I'd need to learn to fulfill each part without using AI cos I find that using AI reduces the possibility of me understanding what I am doing deeply- and I need that.

this project is a tiny contribution to my country and continent. I think that having a hub for all necessary info will aid proper analyses and decision-making. 

that's why it's important to me that I put in the required effort and make it worth not just my while, but that of others.

Lol...I sound idealistic.

I'll get to it then

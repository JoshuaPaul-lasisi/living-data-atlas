Created the repo and cloned it using vscode

then created an env for the postgre

then we created a docker compose for the postgresql databse and pgadmin - making two services

next, 
we changee the port to 5433 since I already have pgadmin on my pc and it is routed to 5432 already.

THen I used pgadmin to create the server using the details in the .env file after loading my docker up.

Apparently, 
I need to create schemas and base tables since my database is empty. I have created the database while registering the server on pgadmin.

These are the schemas. They should keep things tidy this way:

raw → unprocessed API dumps

staging → cleaned but not final

core → final analytics-ready tables

ops → logs, monitoring, etc.
